Why does this blog exist?

It's honestly a fair question. Nowadays, it seems as though everyone and their mother is starting a blog, or a podcast, or something of that sort. There's an endless supply of randos just sharing their opinions everyday now, thinking that their opinion is useful to the general conversation. If I were to tell you that my opinion has merit in comparison, I'd quite frankly be lying. The fact of the matter is I'm a rando too, a rando without any previous knowledge about the subject he's writing about. 

I have a personal goal to listen to more music. I used to think that a lot of entertainment was bogus and it wasn't worth my time. I thought that the deepest conversations that anyone could ever have wouldn't involve art in any way, and would be based on some random philosophical epiphany that people would discuss for hours. However, the more I neglected to care about pop culture, the less I had to talk to people about. So I thought it was time to change up my attitude. I'm not claiming at all to have an important opinion about music or entertainment. I'm no Anthony Fantano or some other guy that reviews music. I don't really know where this blog will lead me. It's just a place to record how I feel about the music I listen to, and for now, I think that's enough of an explanation.
